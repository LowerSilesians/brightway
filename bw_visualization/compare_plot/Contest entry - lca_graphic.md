## Submitter
lca_graphic is the result of the collaboration of the experience of Florent Blondin, who spent 10 years on LCA datavizualisation  and the skills of TÃ©o Lavisse, a PhD Student at the University of Grenoble and CEA.

## Description
This tool is designed to provide several **easy-to-understand graphics for everyday LCA practionners to quickly analyze** their LCA results in Brightway. 

The tool offers simple methods to display three dashboards :
1. to compare LCA results in different impact categories on the one hand,
2. to analyze the contributions of each activity in different impact categories on the other hand
3. to plot the variations of the contribution of the top processes (for the reference method) for each impact category to assess an potential impact transfer

### Code

An example of the practical use of our tools can be found in the following [notebook]. Unfortunately, dashboards do not appear in the Github. Thus, the code should be executed on an Jupyter Notebook to see the dashboards for real.

[notebook]: https://github.com/teolvs/lca_graphic/blob/main/visualization_contest.ipynb


And the main functions are gathered in two python files : 
The [utils.py](https://github.com/teolvs/lca_graphic/blob/main/utils.py) file gives useful tool for quickly LCA computations and analyse of the contributions.
The [dashboards.py](https://github.com/teolvs/lca_graphic/blob/main/dashboards.py) provides the methods to gather all the results into three dashboards :
1. ```compare``` to compare LCA results in different impact categories on the one hand,
2. ```impact_transfer``` to plot the variations of the contribution of the top processes (for the reference method) for each impact category to identify the impact transfers,
3. ```hotspots``` to analyze the contributions of each activity in different impact categories on the other hand.
All these methods are generated all at once in the method ```lca_graphic```
